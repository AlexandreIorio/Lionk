## 📍 Overview

Li/onk Core is a modular platform developed in .NET designed to enable the management and integration of various components through plugins.
The project is crafted to cater to end users (operators and administrators) as well as plugin developers,
offering maximum flexibility and extensibility. The primary goal is to enhance the quality of life in home environments
by allowing seamless integration and management of various components.

The application provides a web interface for configuring components and visualizing data. Users can easily add new plugins to define additional components.
The application is published as a Docker image for easy deployment, with each release also publishing new NuGet packages to facilitate plugin development.

### Key Features:
- **Dashboard Data Consultation:** Users can continuously monitor component-specific data through an up-to-date dashboard.
- **Alarm Management:** Users receive notifications for system failures or specific component alerts, with options for email or push notifications.
- **Remote Access:** The application is accessible remotely via a web browser.
- **Application Configuration:** Administrators can configure the application, add or remove components, and link components together.
- **Plugin Integration:** Administrators can integrate, activate, or deactivate third-party plugins.
- **User Management:** Administrators can manage users and roles within the application.
- **Data Management:** Administrators can export and delete component-collected data in JSON format.
- **Plugin Development:** Developers have access to comprehensive documentation and SDKs for creating compatible plugins.

### Example Use Case: Boiler Room Control Integration
- **Energy Storage:** Administrators can manage energy storage from a living room chimney.
- **Temperature Optimization:** The system optimizes heat flow based on storage temperatures using a 3-way valve.
- **Auto-Regulation:** The system auto-regulates based on the chimney's temperature.
- **System Alerts:** Notifications are sent if the system fails or if temperatures exceed certain thresholds.

Li/onk Core aims to provide a comprehensive and flexible solution for managing and integrating various components, ensuring seamless operation and extensibility.
